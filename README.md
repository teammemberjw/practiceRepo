# practiceRepo
NOTE: please don't alter this readme file!

This repository is for us to practice on. It isn't the main project, it's just a test. Don't worry about messing it up!

There is an html file that imports a few javascript files. The JS files will be empty, and must be filled by us:



The first javascript file should create some html elements and store them in variables.

  The second javascript file performs some action on the variables (like setting background colors, appending other elements)

  The third appends them to the body of the html page.

  The fourth should contain a loop that animates them somehow.  



There is no specific final product we are looking for, so it will be a bit of a free for all.

You can also try to fill out the html file with more content. (It will be mostly bare in the begining -- not even a "title" element).

Try out some of these things:

-clone the repository

-make changes to your local copy and commit your changes locally

-"squash" insignificant, small commits into larger ones

-create branches

-merge new branch into your master branch

-pull changes from the github repository into your local repository and manage conflicts

-do pull-requests

-tag commits with names to be more easily identified and referenced

Good luck!
